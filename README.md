# AoC2019 My experience


at each problem, I had to choose between C++ and Python, knowing both well

using C++
 -	looked for something similar to python tuples and learned C++ tuples and used them as keys for maps
 -	for problems with strings and for performance
 
using Python:
 -	faster coding
 -	created a library for IntCode computer
 -	used dependency injection between IntCode computer and input/output functions
 -	used cookie to download the input file automatically
 -	created functions for easier work with dictionaries
 -	created a backtracking python that called IntCode application like another terminal application giving inputs and extracting outputs

using javascript:
 -	in hope to save time for very easy problems (first day), I created an [userscript for writing pasted response in HTML form and submitting automatically](https://gist.github.com/petreleon/d65efdc58e9948721b79e2aff4d282a0)

after challenge:
 -	created an [intcode video player and a video-to-intcode converter](https://gist.github.com/petreleon/a599862289ac50cee0fd04a8e59c2e5c)
